# R Package 'urca'

Unit root and cointegration tests encountered in applied econometric
analysis are implemented. This R package is used in the Springer
book
[Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387759661).
The package is hosted on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=urca).

#### !! - Important Disclaimer - !!

This package is a slightly modified version of the officially released ```urca``` package, which I modified for my own specific purposes. I modified the ```ur.df``` class and function so to store optimal lags and extract them for later use. This modification has not been tested outside the limited scope of my code and machine. Additional, minor modifications are planned but not high in priority.
